# The Chaziz Site
The official Chaziz Video Entertainment website. Keep in mind, this isn't a big website (compared to the now-shutdown Project Pheonix, and it's predecessor 2003page). It's mostly just a website for Chaziz Video Entertainment, as well as other stuff.

## To-do List

- [x] Remove "Byigans Icons"
- [ ] Find alternative place to host "Archive" files.
- [ ] ~~Ditch icons from AC:NL, and make new icons using Flash 8/CS3 (might be useful for The Sivity Folks/Sivityigans)~~
- [ ] Make proper CSS for the subsites (they just use inline atm)
