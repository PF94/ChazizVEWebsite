<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Here's the history for the freebuilds.</font></p>
<h2><font color="#FFFFFF">Mid-201? (2017? 2018?): Chazpelo's Modded Freebuild</font></h2>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I only have vague memories of this server, it was 
hosted sometime in the mid-late-2010s (around mid-2017 to around mid-2018).</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The server used the Roblox 2008 colorset, and was 
prematurely shutdown due to a &quot;flamethrower&quot; addon that was accidently enabled 
after private testing, which caused buildings to get greifed. I didn't knew 
about Dedicated then, so it was just hosting it with a standard client. I also 
spammed some random print that I got from some random website, which was cringy 
tbh. I do not have the files for this anymore, as I didn't cared about 
backupping more than what I do now.</font></p>
<h2><font color="#FFFFFF">Early-to-Mid-2019: Chazpelo's Amazing Freebuild (AFB)</font></h2>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The server was started during Super Bowl LIII. In it's 
very early days (Early-February 2019), it was hosted on a lame Dell laptop, 
which had a lame Intel iGPU. I still didn't knew about dedicateds at this point, 
so it was still hosting clientlly. Due to how large the save was becoming, it 
was later moved into being hosted on my 2012 Gaming PC, I begun expriementing 
with timelapses, and figured out how to make a dedicated (it wasn't running 
24/7, though). The server ended up being rebranded into AFB, and was shutdown in 
March 2019, only to be brought back for a day in July 2019 (around when r2000 
came out), but was shutdown after that. I don't remember having AFB hosted on my 
Acer, though.</font></p>
<h2><font color="#FFFFFF">Mid-2020: SlyAlligator's Freebuild and Chit Chat</font></h2>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I ended up not hosting it on v21 due to all of the 
changes making it dependent on Steam. The server was first open in early-July on 
B4v21, and was originally open just for a timelapse expriement, however, due to 
the 3rd B4v21 Annual Anniversary event, it ended up being open </font>
<font color="#00FFFF">until the end of the event (around late-July), after 
which, the server was shutdown, only to be brought back up for testing a new 
colorset, and for New Years 2021. (Planned, schedule might change.)</font></p>
